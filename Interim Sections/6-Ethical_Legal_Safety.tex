\section{Ethical, Safety, and Legal Planning}

\subsection{Ethical}
As this project is based on software design and the implementation of algorithms, there is no area which is potentially unethical.

\subsection{Safety}
As this project is based on software design there is no risk of danger apart from ensuring normal standards for ergonomics are met to avoid injuries such as repetitive strain injury from long periods of information technology use.

\subsection{Legal}
This project does plan to re-implement algorithms published elsewhere, however this is done without using the source code of these algorithms directly, meaning that only the algorithms themselves are being used. In cases where design inspiration or influence is taken (an example of which is covered in Section \ref{subsub:stop}), no code is used verbatim, and credit is given to the original designer.
