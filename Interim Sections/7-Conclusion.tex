\section{Conclusion}
This project intends to create a software package that has a rather unique focus, and a rather large scope. This report should have given a good overview of the groundwork that has been done for the design and implementation of the codebase for the project, and made a good argument for why this software is necessary and why Julia is the correct language for this to be done in. 

Julia stands to be one of the most important languages in numerical computing moving into the coming decade, and for that to come to fruition it needs to have access to as wide a range of software as is available to its contemporaries. Having high-performance, native, and reliable libaries is a crucial step in this process, and it is hoped that this project will play a part in that transition.
