\textbf{
This project concerns the design and implementation of a pair of numerical optimisation software packages that focus on being very simple to extend, modify, and experiment with. The classes of algorithms in question are row action methods, and direct search methods. The intention of the project is to deliver software that utilises the high performance characteristics of Julia to provide good optimisation performance, while also remaining simple to understand, extend, and modify. Each package defines a framework for the implementation of algorithms within the target class, allowing an algorithm designer to quickly build running code within an environment that abstracts many of the more technical or difficult aspects of the software design process. The software as a whole, as well as any algorithms within it, is evaluated on both its correctness and performance, with comparisons made to other existing algorithm implementations and software packages.}
