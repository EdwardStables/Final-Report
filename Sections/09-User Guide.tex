\section{User Guide}\label{section_guide}
This section will give an overview of the main user APIs of both packages, and walkthrough a typical usecase of each. In addition it will go through the process of implementing algorithms within the packages. The information shown here is sourced from the manual pages of the package's documentation. 

As this work is open-source it is hoped that work will be continued on them after the conclusion of the project. For this reason, it is highly likely that the guide shown here will become outdated shortly as the package continues to evolve, therefore the documentaiton for each package should be used as the first reference for its use.
